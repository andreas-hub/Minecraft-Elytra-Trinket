# Elytra Trinket Updated

A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds the Elytra to the cape slot in the Trinkets API.

Requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Trinkets Canary](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets-canary).

This mod is just a fork of [Elytra Trinket Updated](https://github.com/marcel-strba/Minecraft-Elytra-Trinket) which is a fork of [Elytra Trinket](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra_trinket)

Updated to Minecraft version 1.21.11. I got tired of waiting for an update, so I did
it myself.
